This code is still in research and has not been fine tuned or put in a user 
friendly mode. Nonetheless it works fine and has been used for publications.
Briefly: You compute Green functions with okada_green then you use batch_rtokada
to run multiple inversions, this function  invokes rtokada which performs the 
actual inversion.

okada_green is modified from Francois Beauducel's okada85 fucntion available
on the mathworks file exchange.

We are adding support for joint inversions with tide gauge or buoy data.
